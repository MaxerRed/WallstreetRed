WallstreetRed: Derivative Trading Tool
WallstreetRed is a powerful investing tool built using C++ and Python that helps you apply derivative trading techniques to analyze stock price movements. By leveraging both numerical analysis and real-time stock data, this tool assists in making informed investment decisions based on derivatives (rate of change) of stock prices.

Features
Fetch historical stock data using Yahoo Finance.
Calculate price derivatives (rate of change) using C++.
Provide investment advice based on derivative analysis.
Optionally, plot stock prices and their derivatives using matplotlib for better visualization.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
Python 3 and pip
yfinance Python library (to fetch stock data)
Install using pip install yfinance
matplotlib Python library (for plotting)
Install using pip install matplotlib
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run WallstreetRed:

1. Install Python Dependencies
To install the required Python libraries, run the following command:

pip install yfinance matplotlib
2. Compile the C++ Code
Make sure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed on your system.

Navigate to the directory where your derivative_calculator.cpp file is located.
Compile the C++ code with the following command:
g++ -o derivative_calculator derivative_calculator.cpp
This will create an executable file named derivative_calculator in the same directory.

3. Run the Python Script
After compiling the C++ code, you can now run the Python script to fetch stock data, calculate derivatives, and provide investment advice.

Run the script with:

python stock_advisor.py
4. What the Script Does
Once you run the Python script, the tool will:

Fetch stock data: Using the yfinance library, the script retrieves historical stock data for the symbol you input (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
Calculate derivatives: The stock price data is passed to the C++ program, which computes the rate of change (derivatives) of the stock prices.
Provide investment advice: Based on the calculated derivatives, the script will give advice such as:
"The stock is increasing. Consider buying!"
"The stock is decreasing. Consider selling!"
"The stock price is stable. Hold your position."
Plot stock prices and derivatives: The script can optionally plot the historical stock prices alongside their derivatives for visual analysis.
